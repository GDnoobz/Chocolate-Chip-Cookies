# Recipe

This is the recipe that the cookies use. It's very simple, and not that descriptive. Don't worry about using a mixer or chilling the dough, as that isn't something you need to do in this recipe. 

Step 1:
What you first want to do is melt the butter that you have. Melt about 90% of the butter before using a whisk while melting the butter. You don't want to make the butter sizzling hot. 

Step 2:
Next, once the butter is melted, you want to add in your sugar. Whisk in the sugar until well-combined. Also mix in the vanilla extract and egg. 

Step 3:
Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the 3 ingredients into the mixture until combined. You don't want to over-mix the dough. 

Step 4:
Stir in the chocolate chips

Step 5:
Scoop up the dough and place it in a baking sheet, each cookie about 2 inches apart. 

Step 6: 
Bake for about 7-10 minutes, depending on oven heat. 

Voila! You now have some delicious chocolate chip cookies that didn't take that much time to make!
